Supercollider Project for Exams (AVARTS Ionian University Summer 2022) @iani

The following link will move you 
to a youtube playlist which contains 
videos with me composing livecoding 
music in SuperCollider, using the code 
contained in this repository. (second and third are my favourites) :)

The process I followed was what any beginner would do.
I copied simple community-made codes from github to supercollider
and 'played' with them until I understand what's going on.

The 'What's going on' solved by reading carfully 
the "Gentle Introduction to SuperCollider" 
by Bruno Ruviaro (Really, really useful) uploaded 
by my professor Ioannis Zannos @iani .

Also, i want to thank Sound Engraver, her videos are a nice experience and very useful.

My project is not something "wow", 
but I enjoy it, I'm happy about what I did, 
because my programming knowledge is small at the moment.

The world of Supercollider is huge and deep, I have so much more to learn.
